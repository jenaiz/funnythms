funnythms
=========

I want to play around some data structures and some algorithms... just for fun. For now the code is going to be in Java,
but how knows what it can be in the future.


What about the name?
---
Funnythms is an abbreviation of "funny algorithms", but it is not only algorithms if not data structures too :).
